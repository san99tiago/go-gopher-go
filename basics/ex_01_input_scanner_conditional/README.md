# BASIC INPUT SCANNER IN GOLANG

To create a simple GoLang structure for a project, we can execute in the terminal:

```bash
go mod init example.com/input_scanner_conditional
```

This command will create a file called `go.mod`, which has the initial GoLang setup.

The file for this example is `main.go`. This is the "main" package and it works as an input scanner that asks users some information, and then, it prints a specific output based on an operation done from the user's input.

To run the script, we can execute:

```bash
go run main.go
```
