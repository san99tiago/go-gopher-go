# SLICES IN GOLANG

To create a simple GoLang structure for a project, we can execute in the terminal:

```bash
go mod init example.com/slices
```

This command will create a file called `go.mod`, which has the initial GoLang setup.

The file for this example is `main.go`. This is the "main" package and it imports a couple of dependencies.

The overall idea of slices is to add more functionalities to arrays (for example, dynamically change the size of arrays, add elements, and using segments of arrays easily).

To run the script, we can execute:

```bash
go run main.go
```
