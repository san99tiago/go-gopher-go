# VARS/ARRAYS IN GOLANG

To create a simple GoLang structure for a project, we can execute in the terminal:

```bash
go mod init example.com/vars_arrays
```

This command will create a file called `go.mod`, which has the initial GoLang setup.

The file for this example is `main.go`. This is the "main" package and it imports a couple of dependencies.

In this example, there are multiple ways of declaring variables, arrays, and even conversions from types of variables.

To run the script, we can execute:

```bash
go run main.go
```
