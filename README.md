This repository covers the basics of [Go Language (golang)](https://go.dev) from my own learning path. It doesn't follow any strict order/topics, it's just how I personally learnt Go basics for my personal projects.<br>

## Golang Basics and Tutorials :anchor:

This project was created based on multiple online tutorials and resources, such as:

- [Go Documentation --> By: Official Go Community](https://go.dev/doc/)
- [Learn Go Programming - Golang Tutorial for Beginners --> By: freeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/YS4e4q9oBaU)
- [Golang Tutorial for Beginners | Full Go Course --> By: TechWorld with Nana](https://youtu.be/yyUHQIec83I)
- [Learn Go Programming by Building 11 Projects --> By: freeCodeCamp.org](https://youtu.be/jFfo23yIWac?list=PLyTv82e1M2id7LhMZs6XSQHwE3wixOxke)

This repository covers the theory and basic concepts of Golang applications, good practices and some cool examples (from scratch).<br>

If you want to explore more advanced Golang concepts, or have any question related to this repo, feel free to email me and I will be happy to answer you.<br>

The information of this repository is based on many online tutorials, so feel free to use it as a guide for your future projects!<br>

## Dependencies :vertical_traffic_light:

The dependencies are explained in detail for each project, but the most important one is Golang (Go Language), regardless of your operating system.<br>

My advice is to primary understand the way Golang works with basic tutorials, and then try to develop amazing project ideas based on challenges that you can think of!<br>

### Software dependencies (based on project)

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)<br>
  Visual Studio Code is my main code editor for high-level programming. This is not absolutely necessary, but from my experience, it gives us a great performance and we can link it with Git and GitHub easily.<br>

- [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)<br>
  Go is an amazing programming language with features such as memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and built-in concurrency.<br>

## Usage :dizzy:

All projects are really well commented and most of them have specifications and remarks for their purpose and I/O.<br>

I will be uploading most of the files/contents, and try to keep it as clean as possible.<br>

## Special thanks :gift:

- Thanks to all contributors of the great OpenSource projects that I am using.<br>
