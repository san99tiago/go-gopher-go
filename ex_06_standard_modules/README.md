# STANDARD MODULES IN GOLANG

To create a simple GoLang structure for a project, we can execute in the terminal:

```bash
go mod init example.com/standard_modules
```

This command will create a file called `go.mod`, which has the initial GoLang setup.

Additionally, the file for this example is `main.go`. This is the "main" package and it imports a couple of dependencies.

To run the script, we can execute one of the following:

```bash
go run main.go
```

```bash
go build .
```

```bash
go install .
```
