# HISTORY OF GOLANG

## Where it was created and overall picture

It was created in 2009 by a small group of Google talented engineers (mainly by Robert Griesemar, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson). It has features such as memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and built-in concurrency.<br>

## Why it was created?

At the time, there were 3 main common key languages inside Google. They were Java, C/C++ and Python. Each one was very powerful, but they had limitations such as:

- Python --> Easy to use, but slow in large implementation.
- Java --> Increasingly complex type system.
- C/C++ --> Complex type system and slow compile times.

All three languages were created on a time were multi-threading applications were rare, making it hard to work with concurrency developments.<br>

Go (Golang) advantages to overcome challenges are:

- Strong and statically typed (type of variables can not change over time).
- Excellent community that focuses on making sure that Go language keeps moving forward.
- Simplicity.
- Fast compile times.
- High-performance networking and multiprocessing.
- Garbage collected (Go runtime manages it).
- Built-in concurrency development.
- Compile to standalone binaries (Go runtime and libraries are compiled all together).
